        <h1>Amarachi Emeziem</h1>
        <p><em>Student.</em><br><em>Department of <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/">Computer Information Science</a><br />Ithaca, New York.<br>14850 </em></p>

        <p>My name is Amarachi, a dual master's graduate student at <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a>Cornell University in the field of Computer Information Science and International Development. I was born and raised in a
          small
          community Umuakwali Obodo Ahiara Ahiazu Mbaise Imo State
          situated in the eastern part of Nigeria but now living in the United State of America. I am a Front End/Web Developer.
          I am a gender equality advocate who hopes to form an NGO where women can come together and discuss their needs and the wellness of their girl child. Also, I am a Science Technology Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) advocate for the rural
          girls
          around the underserved world.
          Singing is part of my life, just try me and see how it flows with ease. Due to my most interest in singing, I participated in a Bilingual singing competition of <a href="https://www.cornell.edu/">Cornell University</a><a
            href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtzxHROjXG8">Alma Mater Anthem</a> where I won the second positionüíÉüèøüíÉüèø. It motivates me on a daily basis. I love to travel and meet people from different backgrounds of Knowledge. I am always open
          to new
          knowledge and would love to learn more
          about how to create a peaceful and sustainable environment. Part of my inspiration comes from women who are in STEM education like <a href="https://www.nasa.gov/content/katherine-johnson-biography">Katherine Johnson</a>who was a <a
            href="https://www.nasa.gov/">NASA</a> Space Scientist and hoping to develop my career more in this area of specialization.</p>
